This Github repository contains a set of R functions to build visualizations of various bits of quantified life data. My goal is to build meaningful and interesting visualizations based on the works and philosophies of Edward Tufte. If you're not familiar with his work, check out the [Visual Display of Quantitative Information](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0961392142/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0961392142&linkCode=as2&tag=mikesheanet-20).

These functions are intended as a toolbox of various ways to model data and feed it to an output. You'll likely need to spend some time with R yourself before these will be of any use.

This repo includes a couple of large sample datasets these scripts can run upon.

Consider it a public junk drawer of useful R visualization ideas.
